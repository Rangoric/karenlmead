Karen also publishes other urban fantasy works, like the parody novella Penguin of Fortune and an upcoming Mermaid book.</p>\n<p>Karen also writes sweet romance with the Traveling Billionaire series, because she never gets to go anywhere and enjoys living vicariously through her characters.</p>\n<p>She’s also completed a short memoir, <a href=\"/non-fiction\">Overleveled: My Life in Videogames</a> because being a bi-genre author just wasn’t confusing enough and she wanted to throw an entirely different type of writing in there. Seriously though, check out the memoir, it’s pretty special.</p>\n<p>She lives on Long Island, New York with her husband, daughter, and about ten imaginary cats. Someday, she will work up the courage to buy a real cat.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to follow her on social media, she’s active on both <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KarenMead-112714693417888\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/karenmead_author/\">Instagram</a>.
