Daniel is a tech billionaire, while Nora works minimum wage at a big-box store. When Daniel takes an interest in her, Nora can hardly believe it. As they grow closer, she’s still not sure what he’s truly interested in: her, or her artwork? Worse, it’s possible that he just wants a poor girl to rescue, and she’s only his latest project. What will he do when she confronts him about his motives?

In the first book of the Traveling Billionaire series, an older, wiser couple finds love amidst the beautiful scenery of the Greek Islands.

Nora is getting used to having a suave billionaire boyfriend. When he asks her if she’ll take a trip to sunny Brisbane, Australia with him, it’s a no-brainer.

And Daniel wants something else from her, something she’s afraid she can’t give.

In Book Two of The Traveling Billionaire, a smart, sensitive couple navigates the rocky shoals of their new relationship…with a little help from high-quality tea and coffee.
