It’s a neat review, even though she has some serious criticisms of Sam’s behavior (wait…don’t we all?) I hope she keeps up with the blog because there’s a serious lack of this kind of thing online. Urban fantasy usually gets gobbled up into a larger fantasy category, which is then dominated by Epic fantasy. So definitely check the blog out today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the first three books of the series are now available on non-Kindle ereaders; the fourth book will also be available shortly, I just need to wait a few more days before its Amazon-exclusivity period ends. This means that the books are no longer enrolled in Kindle Unlimited, which is only for Amazon exclusives. I’ll miss being a part of that program, but there’s such a big world out there that I didn’t feel like being tethered to Amazon was the best choice for my series anymore. Now all the people who own Nooks and Kobos and all that other good stuff can have some demon-enhanced reading material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Book Five is coming along. I thought I was going to take a break after Book Four and work on some other stories, but the DC characters are very impatient and kept telling me to write their series. Yes, I hallucinate getting lectures from my own characters, what’s the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you’re all safe and sound and enjoying the wrap-up of summer. I’m hoping to get in one beach trip before the weather changes; wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Review: Any Witch Way You Can]]></title><description><![CDATA[I read this book because I was trying to figure out just what the heck is going on with Amanda M.

Lee, the author. Apparently Ms. Lee has been writing something like 20 books a year for about a decade, and now has over 200 books to her name. How is this possible? How can anyone write decent books at that kind of crazy pace? What is this SORCERY?&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I still don’t know what Lee’s secret is, but at least now I know that she does write decent books. Any Witch Way You Can didn’t rock my world, but it was a perfectly entertaining cozy mystery…at least, I think it’s a cozy mystery. More on that in a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wicked Witches of the Midwest series has a clever premise. The small town of Hemlock Cove saw its businesses move elsewhere, so instead of giving up, the town rebranded itself as a kitschy tourist town. The whole town is witch-themed, kind of like Salem, Massachusetts but without the historical connection. In this environment, the Winchester women– a family full of real, honest-to-Hecate witches– can live freely, knowing that everyone will assume that their oddities are just part of the witchy role-playing that everyone in town does. On a meta level, there’s something darkly humorous about the idea that, in the face of globalization, the answer is to become a witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Witch Way You Can is the first installment of the Wicked Witches series, so a lot of page real estate is spent introducing Hemlock Cove and the various Winchesters. The story mainly focuses on Bay, editor of the the town’s weekly “newspaper,” (It’s more of an advertising blurb) and her younger cousins, Thistle and Clove. I know Lee has real newspaper experience, so I enjoy the details about Bay’s job. The other two sisters work at a magic shop, which sounds fun. I want to work at a magic shop that sells crystals and herbs and stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the above, the main thing you need to know about this series (and Lee’s work in general, from what I’ve heard) is that the characters are constantly arguing with each other, holding grudges, getting revenge on each other for slights real or imagined, etc. Lee even apologizes for this in the afterword, saying that she has a particular sense of humor and not everyone likes it. I’m on the fence myself: sometimes it’s funny, sometimes it just makes the characters seem incredibly immature, like they’re in middle school. Also, even when the characters hijinks are funny, it gets old when it just. Keeps. Happening. Always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I’m currently in the middle of Book 4 of this series, so obviously the style of the humor didn’t put me off that much. It’s still an entertaining series of mysteries…I just wish that this brand of humor could be toned down, not taken away entirely. Then again, Lee seems to be very successful in her niche of the mystery world, so I can’t think of any good reason why she should listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m honestly not sure if this is “cozy” mystery. For cozies, I imagine a nice lady who bakes pie every day and slowly investigates who stole the float for the town parade, or something mild like that. This book features two fairly gruesome murders, and to me that takes the coziness factor away. Is it possible cozy mysteries have been this hardcore for a while now, and I’m just showing my ignorance about the genre? I have much to learn about pie-baking sleuths, apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I recommend this series, with the caveat that if you like your protagonists to act smart and mature, this is probably not a story for you. But in the book I just read, Thistle and Bay had an angry snowball fight and Thistle dumped fresh snow down the back of Bay’s coat, and I am here for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Review: Vampire Girl Series]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of the things I’d like to do on this author blog is review some series that are in my preferred genres, so why not start today?

This is a little bit risky, because someone might react to a critical review by having their fans review-bomb my books, but I’m not going to worry about that too much for right now. Today I’m talking about a series that I found pretty enjoyable, so that’s a non-issue. I mean…I think it’s a non-issue. You guys are nice, right Karpov Kinrade fans?&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Vampire Girl! For starters, I’ve never read an ostensibly vampire-led series where vampirism is less important. Despite the title, the lead character is not a vampire, and blood drinking almost never comes up. There are a lot of characters who are vampires, but just about all of their blood-drinking occurs off-page. I can’t say the vampire angle is totally avoided, since there are a few scenes where it becomes relevant, but it’s an interesting choice to sideline most of the common vampire tropes. Maybe the author thinks we’re bored with them? They may be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(psst, Karpov Kinrade is actually a team, hence calling the author “they.” I’m not sure if I’m supposed to pretend it’s actually one author, but they’re pretty open about the situation so I’ll just go with “they” as the pronoun of choice here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why this series can get away with playing the vampire business so lightly is because it’s really an epic fantasy dressed up in urban fantasy clothing. That’s not a bad thing (at least, not for me), but there’s an element of bait-and-switch here. The first 50 pages or so feel like an urban fantasy, with main girl Arianna hanging out in modern-day Portland, then she gets transported to the world of Inferna and the real world never matters again. Wait, no, I can think of one time where it matters, but that’s it. As much as I enjoyed the story, I do wish the real world featured more in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Arianna gets to Inferna (what we mere mortals might call Hell), there’s lots of problems to dig into. The vampires hate the fae, the fae hate the vampires, and there’s vampire-fae hybrids that are hated by everyone, and so on and so forth. Inferna is an interesting locale, but I’m not certain it ever felt truly real to me. Sometimes it felt like the place was really huge, and sometimes it felt really tiny, and that didn’t sit right with me. It’s a minor issue overall, but I think the worldbuilding could have been tighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arianna has to date the Princes of Hell, all sexy vampires, if she wants to complete her quest. You’d think we’d be in paranormal romance territory…but actually, not so much. Once again, the set-up is deceptive. It seems at first like seeing all the different vampires romance Ari is going to be the main draw, then it quickly becomes about Arianna addressing the myriad social problems of Inferna, and dating takes a backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ari is a likable heroine, one who throws herself into the action without waiting for permission from anyone. She’s in danger of being too perfect, but her headstrong nature does count as an imperfection, I suppose; it certainly worries the Princes of Hell enough. This is where more time spent in the real world would have been helpful, because we’d learn more of what Ari is like when she isn’t in her prophesied-princess role, which comes with its own extensive list of tropes. As it is, we know her as well as we need to, and no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series has two main arcs– the first four books, and the last three. During the first four, I was pretty engaged with the story, even though it made me raise an eyebrow at times. During the second arc, I was partially checked out. This is where Kindle Unlimited makes a difference, because it was easier to commit to finishing the series when I wasn’t paying for the books. If I didn’t have a KU subscription, I might have stopped somewhere in the middle of book six. The second arc isn’t bad (and the first-person narrative is fun), but it’s less compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend this to readers who enjoy both urban fantasy and more traditional fantasy; if you only like one or the other, this series may annoy you with its habit of being about 12 genres at once. If you’re looking for paranormal romance, this series has what you’re looking for, but only in small doses; hardcore PNR fans may want to look elsewhere. Then again, even PNR fans like to read a nice epic fantasy with princes and princesses sometimes, right?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Urban Fantasy]]></title><description><![CDATA[Check out Karen’s flagship series, Demonic Café.

How is she supposed to find the time to serve a Demon Lord?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassie divides her time between working a cash register and studying like crazy to get accepted to a top-tier university. She’s on track until one fateful day, a spell cast by one mysterious barista transforms her from a regular teen to a valuable familiar: a magical well a demon can tap. Now all the creatures of Hell are fighting over her, and the demon who bound her would rather serve lattes than deal with it. She’d be happy to protect herself, but how can she do that when she can’t even cast spells yet? Cassie had better figure it out fast, or else she has a better chance of becoming some demon’s little pet than making the Dean’s List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Cassie in the first book of Demonic Café, a vibrant urban fantasy world of snarky demons, vicious black magic spells, political intrigue, and paranormal coffee…well, the coffee is normal, but it’s prepared by paranormal creatures. Drink at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

It would help if she could cast a spell.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not easy being a teenaged witch. Or maybe it is? Cassie wouldn’t know, since she’s still a familiar: a magical well a demon can tap. She’s trying to learn magic, but the prereqs are a little scary and anyway, who has the time? There’s another familiar to snatch, snotty demons in dinner jackets to sort out, and political schemes that threaten the whole world order to foil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe before she starts slinging spells around, Cassie should learn who and what she really is. However, considering the fact she’s drawn the attention of the biggest, baddest witch around, who she is might not be as big a revelation as who she’s up against. She’d better get a clue fast, because the demons are still after her—and this time, they’ve brought company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Cassie in the second book of Demonic Café, an exciting urban fantasy world filled with powerful demons, cheeky vampires, crafty witches, divine beasts, and lighting things on fire just for the hell of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassie has mixed feelings about progressing her relationship with Sam, her sort-of boyfriend, coffee-shop co-worker and demonic master. She does have feelings for him, but their whole relationship is just this side of creepy. This situation is not helped by the fact that Sam’s fellow demons are very close to declaring him too dangerous to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now she and her friends have to travel to Las Vegas for Sam’s court hearing, which will determine whether he should be treated as a full-blooded demon under demonic law. If the trial goes badly for Sam, Cassie will be up for grabs. The last thing she wants is a bunch of demons fighting over her (again), but with the mysterious Seraph gunning for her (and all of her friends), who’s holding her leash may be the least of her problems. They say that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but whoever said “The House Always Wins” probably never had several hundred demons in the house….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Cassie in the third book of Demonic Café, a magical urban fantasy world filled with handsome devils, sumptuous hotels, gorgeous gowns, and one Blessed Leviathan that never met a body of water it didn’t like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s finally time for Cassie to sit for the Test to End All Tests, only she has a problem: is the upcoming Apocalypse going to happen before the test, or after? Knowing that would really help her decide how much time to spend studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even clear who’s going to cause the Apocalypse. Will it be Cassie’s deranged relatives, tired of captivity? Will it be an army of magical phantasms, powerful beyond mortal comprehension and available in a stunning array of neon colors? Or will it be Sam, who’s realizing that his Antichrist potential is seriously off the charts (and can you believe it took him this long?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever form it takes, Cassie and Sam need to stop any and all Apocalypses even if they need to destroy the world to do it…and at the rate they’re going, they just might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Cassie and Sam in the fourth book of Demonic Café, an epic urban fantasy world where going Old Testament on everyone is not only a viable option, but usually the best.&lt;/p&gt;

What’s so great about wolves anyway? They’re just like dogs, only not as cute. In contrast, Pen’s pudgy bird form is both adorable and practical. Forget the lupine drama queens: Werepenguins are the new hotness in paranormal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that mysterious police commissioner Clayton Crane has his eye on her, can Penelope keep her secret and protect the city from a new undead menace at the same time? More importantly, will she be able to make enough smart-mouth comments en route to prove how independent she is, even when she should just shut up and do her job?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penguin of Fortune is a spine-tingling, pulse-pounding urban fantasy novella in the hot-female-bounty-hunter-with-magic-and-an-attitude genre, but also completely original because it has penguins in it, SO THERE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sweet Romance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Rescued from Retail The Traveling Billionaire Series, Book One  Does he love her, or does he only love her art?

A Clean, Sweet Billionaire Romance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel is a tech billionaire, while Nora works minimum wage at a big-box store. When Daniel takes an interest in her, Nora can hardly believe it. As they grow closer, she’s still not sure what he’s truly interested in: her, or her artwork? Worse, it’s possible that he just wants a poor girl to rescue, and she’s only his latest project. What will he do when she confronts him about his motives?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first book of the Traveling Billionaire series, an older, wiser couple finds love amidst the beautiful scenery of the Greek Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately he did.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nora is getting used to having a suave billionaire boyfriend. When he asks her if she’ll take a trip to sunny Brisbane, Australia with him, it’s a no-brainer. However, things are not what they seem: if Nora wants some quality time with the kangaroos, she’s going to have to pose as Daniel’s wife. And Daniel wants something else from her, something she’s afraid she can’t give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Book Two of The Traveling Billionaire, a smart, sensitive couple navigates the rocky shoals of their new relationship…with a little help from high-quality tea and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Non-fiction]]></title><description><![CDATA[Overleveled: My Life in Videogames  In Overleveled: My Life in Videogames, writer Karen L.

&lt;p&gt;In Overleveled: My Life in Videogames, writer Karen L. Mead looks at her long history of gaming and tries to figure out what’s going on. How do the memories of time spent in imaginary worlds interface with our memories of real places? Is it possible for memories of games to be more genuine in some ways than memories of real locations, and if so, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mead looks at incredibly popular, era-defining games like Super Mario Brothers, Final Fantasy VII and Starcraft among others to see how these games became both a part of her life and an escape from it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her primary genre is urban fantasy, where she writes about demons and vampires and all the trimmings in the Demonic Café series. Karen also publishes other urban fantasy works, like the parody novella Penguin of Fortune and an upcoming Mermaid book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen also writes sweet romance with the Traveling Billionaire series, because she never gets to go anywhere and enjoys living vicariously through her characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s also completed a short memoir, &lt;a href=&quot;/non-fiction&quot;&gt;Overleveled: My Life in Videogames&lt;/a&gt; because being a bi-genre author just wasn’t confusing enough and she wanted to throw an entirely different type of writing in there. Seriously though, check out the memoir, it’s pretty special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She lives on Long Island, New York with her husband, daughter, and about ten imaginary cats. Someday, she will work up the courage to buy a real cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to follow her on social media, she’s active on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/KarenMead-112714693417888&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/karenmead_author/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.
